# Very simple deployment of a Linux Ubuntu VM

This template deploys a **Linux VM Ubuntu** using the latest patched version. This will deploy a Standard_B2s size VM and a 18.04-LTS Version as defaultValue in the resource group location and will return the admin user name, Virtual Network Name, Network Security Group Name and FQDN.
